        <h4>episode 1</h4>
        <p>
            The series begins in the "Ron'coffee" internet café, where Elliot invites himself to sit down at the table of the chain's owner.
            Elliot tells him that he knows his name is Rohit Mehta and that when he first opened his internet café, he was nicknamed Ron.
            Elliot also knows that he owns 17 internet cafés and will soon have eight more. Elliot tells him that he likes this particular internet café because it has a gigabit internet connection.
            Elliot, surprised, starts intercepting the network traffic and notices something strange, then decides to hack it.
            Elliot discovered that he was hosting a website called "The Sons of Plato" behind the Tor network to remain anonymous.
            Elliot found him anyway and told him that "onion routing isn't as anonymous as it seems, and by controlling the exit nodes, you control the traffic." 
            Elliot placed a folder on the table containing all his emails, files, and photos. 
            The boss told him he was going to call the police.
            Elliot retorts, "So they can find 100 terabytes of child pornography that he shares with his 400,000 members?"
            Elliot says things would have been much simpler if it had been sadomasochism.
            Elliot explains that his father died of leukemia due to radiation from E Corp.
            Elliot leaves, telling him he's not interested in the money. 
            Then, the police come to arrest the boss after an anonymous tip from Elliot.
            Elliot Alderson works at Allsafe, a cybersecurity company. 
            At night, he hacks into the social media accounts and bank statements of his acquaintances, particularly those of his childhood friend Angela, his therapist Krista, and Shayla, his drug supplier. 
            He stores this data on CDs disguised as music albums.
            He regularly uses morphine while also taking Suboxone, a withdrawal medication, to avoid becoming addicted.
            He also uses his hacking skills to track down criminals and turn them over to the police.
            E Corp, a conglomerate and Allsafe Security's largest client, is under attack.
            They initially believe it's a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, but it turns out to be a rootkit.
            Elliot stops the attack and secures the evidence (a file named fsociety00.dat), which is actually a message addressed to him instructing him to leave the file on the server, which he does after securing it. 
            On his way home, Elliot is approached on the subway by Mr. Robot, the man who posted the message.
            He leads Fsociety, the group of hackers behind the cyberattack. 
            Mr. Robot is implementing a financial revolution that would lead to a general redistribution of wealth by deleting all of E Corp's financial statements.
            He wants to convince Elliot to join their cause. Initially hesitant, Elliot eventually agrees. 
            He blames E Corp's technical director, Terry Colby, for the attack by altering the history file.
